The goal of this project is to create a GPA calculator, that can take in future classes, past classes, and current
classes. And displaying the information in a GUI. The project uses the tkinter python package to create the gui.

Things to be done:
get some error catching in place
figure out a way to tab focus only on the credit hrs, grade, and enter widgets
add support to enter a total number of credit hours and grade points/ gpa and start calculating from there
